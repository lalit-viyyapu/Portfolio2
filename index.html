								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>I am Lalit Madhav Viyyapu, born and raised in Hyderabad, India. My academic journey began in mechanical engineering, where I earned my bachelor's degree at Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, but my curiosity for technology and data-driven problem-solving led me down a different path. During my internship as an Application Analyst, I was exposed to the world of IT, where I worked on troubleshooting, system optimization, and application support. This experience sparked my interest in data analytics, programming, and cloud technologies, inspiring me to pivot my career toward IT. Determined to build expertise in this field, I decided to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Information Technology and Management in the United States at the <i>University of Texas at Dallas</i>. </br></br>
									My transition into IT was driven by a passion for solving real-world problems using data. Learning programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, alongside frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, helped me dive deeper into data science and analytics. I have worked on various academic projects, ranging from database management systems to machine learning models for mental health analysis. Beyond academics, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technological advancements, automating workflows, and optimizing business processes. My goal is to blend my analytical mindset with technical skills to deliver impactful insights and innovative solutions. As I continue on this journey, I look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals and applying my skills in real-world scenarios.</p>
